##  :pushpin: ABOUT

Working towards creaiting a SPA/web game playable on desktops and mobile phones. 
The aim of the game is to guess what year the photograph shown was taken beginning from 1900 to present 2023. 
A score system will keep track based on how close the user was to the correct answer.
Displaying the final score at the end - with the ability to share to friends.

## :cry: Challenges faced :cry:
- Changing my mind set around updating the DOM in React.
- Learning how to useState/passing props down to child components
- A few teething issues getting firebase auto deploy through gitHub working. 


## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- Slight delay in photo updating while the state updates.


## :sunglasses: Most Enjoyable Features or Tasks:  :two_hearts:
- Having that 'Aha' moment with passing information down to components has made me excited to continue learning/using React. 


## :sob: Lessons learnt
- States should be created in the highest relevant component and passed down. I initially thought I could pass information up from states created within the child easily.

## :white_check_mark: Future Features
- Planning to add a log in/users backend through firebase
- Highscores table
