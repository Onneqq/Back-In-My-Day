# B.I.M.D

My final GA Project!

##  :pushpin: ABOUT

We are working towards a Single Page Application that allows users to create their own characters. These characters can level up, adjust abilities, do what RPG games do. After some time bouncing ideas around and trying to be as realistic as possible - We have decided to water the general idea down.
We are now aiming to make a game that is similar to idle clicker games. The theme is: *pixelated RPG*.
