My final GA Project!

##  :pushpin: ABOUT

Working towards creaiting a SPA/web game playable on desktops and mobile phones. 
The aim of the game is to guess what year the photograph shown was taken beginning from 1900 to present 2023. 
A score system will keep track based on how close the user was to the correct answer.
Displaying the final score at the end - with the ability to share to friends.
